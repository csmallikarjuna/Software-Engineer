Water Quality Analysis:

Physical Factors including suspended materials (called suspended solids) and dissolved substances (dissolved solids)
Chemical Factors including concentrations of ions, pollutants, etc…
Biological Factors including presence of organisms, plankton, macroinvertebrates, fish, nutrients, etc…

Measuring Water Clarity:

Turbidity is a measure of the degree to which the water looses its transparency due to the presence of suspended particulates. 
A turbidity measurement could be used to provide an estimation of the TSS (Total Suspended Solids)

Causes of Turbidity:

There are various parameters influencing the cloudiness of the water. Some of these are: 
Phytoplankton, Sediments from erosion, Resuspended sediments from the bottom, Waste discharge, Algae growth, Urban runoff

Ways to Measure Turbidity:

Turbidity is measured in NTU: Nephelometric Turbidity Units. The instrument used for measuring it is called nephelometer, colorimeter or turbidimeter, which measures the intensity of light scattered at 90 degrees as a beam of light passes through a water sample.
In lakes or bays, turbidity is measured with a secchi disk

Turbidity Values?

Turbidity is measured in NTUs and sometimes FTUs (Forel Turbidity Units)
No suspended solids present is a value of O NTU, while drinking water should be no more than 5 NTU

Colorimetry & Spectrophotometry:

One useful and often used way of determining the concentration of a chemical in a solution, if it has a color, is to measure the intensity of the color and relate the intensity of the color to the concentration of the solution.
